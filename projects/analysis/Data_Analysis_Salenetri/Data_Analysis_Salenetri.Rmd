## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages("tidycensus")
install.packages("arcos")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("janitor")
install.packages("scales")
install.packages("ggrepel")

```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
library(arcos)
library(janitor)
library(scales)
library(ggrepel)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
ARCOSkey <- "uO4EK6I"

arcos_county_pills_per_year <- summarized_county_annual(key = ARCOSkey) %>%
  clean_names()
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
